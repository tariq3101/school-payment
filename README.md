## ⚙️ Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/tariq3101/school-payment.git
cd school-payment
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

#### Backend
```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

#### Frontend
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

---

## ▶️ Usage

### Run Backend
```bash
cd backend
npm run start
```
Or
```
nodemon index.js
```

### Run Frontend
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

The frontend should now be available at `http://localhost:8080` (or configured port).  
The backend will run on `http://localhost:5000` (or configured port).

---

## 🔧 Configuration
Both backend and frontend may require environment variables. Create a `.env` file in each directory with values like:

```
PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=your_database_url
JWT_SECRET=your_secret
API_KEY=your_payment_provider_key
```

*(Update based on actual configuration in code.)*

---

## 📦 Dependencies

### Backend
- Node.js
- Express
- TypeScript
- Database client (e.g. MongoDB)

### Frontend
- React / Tyepscript
- CSS / Tailwind 
- Axios for API calls

*(Exact list comes from `package.json` files.)*

---

## 🛠 Troubleshooting
- **App not starting?** Check Node.js version (`>=16` recommended).
- **Database connection error?** Ensure your `.env` contains the correct `MONGO_URI`.
- **CORS issues?** Confirm backend CORS policy allows frontend origin.
